# Pupper

## :octocat: Pet Entertainment TV

The idea for Pupper stemmed from Team Awesome Possum's collective love for our pets. The plan was to create a page that we could stream onto our televisions while we're away that would entertain our pets! We brainstormed on what our page would look like for the user, how they could select what their pet would see and "favorite" those videos for next time using the YouTube API. Little did some of us know, there is a lot of really interesting and stimulating content for all sorts of pets (birds included). In addition to YouTube, we linked the Giphy API to populate a giph associated with the type of pet the user selects. Who doesn't love a pet gif?

## How It Works

:curly_loop: Add your and your pet's information. This will bring you a grettings text with a cute gif from Giphy!

:curly_loop: Search for the videos, and if you like them, you can add them to your favorites. You can save your own personalized video messages as well.

__*Next Steps*__
Ideally Pupper would become a website that allowed users to create personalize accounts, build playlists, throw in personalized videos of themselves for their pet and control the content of what is playing remotely.
